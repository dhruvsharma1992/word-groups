word-groups
===========
 A simple django application through which you can store words through word-groups. Search efficient and configurable, you can add your own words and with  a refresh it would be added to the table.
 
 Installation
=============
 
 Requirements:
 
 1) django 1.7
 
 2) djangorestframework (pip instal djangorestframework)
 
 
 Setup
======
 clone the repository and  open the cmd to navigate to django_app folder in the repository's directory.  type: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0{port}.. port can be any number preferably above 1000 
 
 I will  upload a installation  shell/bat  script  soon so  that  you can  install the  app  just  by  running  a single script.
 
 ENJOY
